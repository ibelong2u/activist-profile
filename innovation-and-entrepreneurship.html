<br />
Sawmill Hollow, the Pittz family farm, grew out of Andrew&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; dream to run their own small farm and business. After working in several cities across the Heartland, they returned home to Missouri Valley and planted Sawmill Hollow&rsquo;s first aronia bushes. Soon after, the Pittz family first experienced many of the difficulties in launching a small business. Years passed, and the farm was doing well. After graduating from Texas A&amp;M, Andrew returned home to build upon the foundation he and his parents set. Starting with zero retail accounts, Andrew set out to create a business conscious of its impact on its community. The Sawmill Hollow Portfolio now distributes to both small health stores and Fortune 500 companies across the Midwest, as far as Hawaii, and even won the Community Business of the Year Award in 2009. In addition to running the Sawmill Hollow retail portfolio, Andrew speaks with groups of all sizes about innovation, starting small businesses, and the benefits of social entrepreneurship &nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;For my family, entrepreneurship means that if you work hard and create win-win opportunities with those around you, we can all succeed. It&rsquo;s about working together to extend the American Dream.&rdquo; --Andrew Pittz&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<strong>What&rsquo;s Good for Society is Good for Business</strong><br />
<br />
Milton Friedman once famously argued that the &ldquo;only social responsibility of business is to increase profits.&rdquo; Andrew believes that businesses must move beyond simple acts of &ldquo;Corporate Social Responsibility&rdquo; -- often executed as charity for charity&rsquo;s sake -- to work with a community to create shared value. This creates a capitalist system where every citizen becomes a stakeholder in a business&rsquo;s success. Rather than limiting the economic potential of a business, Andrew argues that by creating shared value platforms we can actually expand a firm&rsquo;s bottom line, fulfilling both Friedman&rsquo;s social responsibility principle and ensuring communities benefit from private sector success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Investing in our Youth</strong><br />
<br />
A recent Gallup poll showed nearly half of high school students plan to start their own businesses. Unfortunately, many students lack the appropriate skills and resources to develop long-term organizations. In America, the four year failure rate for start-ups is approximately 66%. By partnering with local organizations, businesses, and universities, Andrew Pittz is leading the Midwest youth entrepreneurship movement. His unique curriculum culminates in the Annual Youth Entrepreneurship and Farm Day, next held in September, 2012. Andrew has spoken with many student organizations about getting the right tools to grow their own small businesses, as well as the importance of entrepreneurship education.

<strong>Sharing Knowledge</strong><br />
<br />
Many start-up failures have three basic flaws: poor organizational structure, a flawed strategy, and a lack of experience at the top. Some of Andrew&rsquo;s most popular &ldquo;talks&rdquo; are with businesses and entrepreneurs to share experiences. These presentations range from informative to motivational, and are tailored to meet the needs of the audience.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew&#39;s understanding of innovation is unparalleled. His greatest strength is in his ability to see beyond the quarterly deadline and communicate the vision of the organization.&quot;<br />
