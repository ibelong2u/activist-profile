<strong>A Fork in the Road</strong><br />
<br />
The Pittz home and business sits at the fork of a dirt and gravel road. Much like the rest of the United States, rural economic development sits at a 21st century fork in the road. Expanding the privat sector is crucial, but rural America&rsquo;s next great challenge will be balancing &ldquo;complex development&rdquo;, like promoting innovation, with &ldquo;simple development&rdquo; like paving roads. A stronger transportation system will provide better access to new businesses, and strengthen other development efforts. That said, Both public and private sector leaders must serve the community to work to retain population, preserve great public schools, and create better jobs for Americans.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Economic development is the engine that grows communities. Without it, folks leave, schools close, and hometowns become ghost towns. This is our time to double down on our shared values and invest to extend the American Dream.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Andrew Pittz<br />

<strong>Creating an Entrepreneurial Climate</strong><br />
<br />
The first step to developing long-term economic growth is creating a business friendly environment. Over the past 15 years, 65% of new jobs have come from small businesses. Unfortunately, when politicians talk about what businesses need to succeed, the policies often pit companies against communities. By definition, entrepreneurship means finding needs and innovatively addressing them. We need to do a better job connecting like-minded entrepreneurs to discover these needs within their own communities, as well as share individual successes and failures. Additionally, by developing economic industry clusters and promoting public-private partnerships, it is possible to create a climate friendly to both entrepreneurs and the general public.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Developing Economic Clusters</strong><br />
<br />
For most businesses, creating value means optimizing short-term profits. While this generates an enormous amount of wealth for a select few, it often fails to create a viable long-term business model and is a major contributor to the 66% four year failure rate for many start-ups. In order to make economic clusters, or firms that complement each other within a localized region, feasible, businesses will have to shift from a quarterly perspective to one that ensures long-term stability and growth. Sawmill Hollow, Andrew&rsquo;s farm and business, utilizes several other small firms within Iowa to generate &ldquo;co-prosperity.&rdquo; These joint efforts not only expand the total wealth within a region, they also enhance the individual firms&rsquo; competitiveness.<br />
<br />
One example of the success of these industry clusters are the aerospace and aviation programs near Houston, Texas. There, businesses and schools emphasize research, development, and implementation of these engineering programs all within a single region. In Texas alone, more than 2,000 aerospace companies have created more than 184,000 jobs.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Public-Private Partnerships</strong><br />
<br />
Many states face increasingly difficult budget constraints and are forced to tackle an growing number of public concerns. One way to address these issues are through public-private partnerships and product-development partnerships. One field where these partnerships are particularly powerful is university research. There, these partnerships have the potential to strengthen individual research initiatives, promote economic development, and encourage the commercialization of student-faculty innovations. These efforts also help the local government provide needed services while simultaneously limiting the burden felt by taxpayers.<br />
<br />
In 2006, Oregon instituted a public-private partnership designed to improve its lagging transportation system. Since then, highway and rail projects have been completed quickly and efficiently. This resulted in dramatic savings in infrastructure projects as well as a transfer of project risk from the taxpayer to the partner business. While many of these programs are funded through a user cost, such as a highway toll, Oregon also implemented a &ldquo;performance pay&rdquo; system, further protecting its citizens from any potential liability.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;The waste, fraud, and abuse we see in taxpayer-funded programs undermines the trust&nbsp; folks place in their public servants. Public-private partnerships involve everyday citizens and make businesses stakeholders in their communities. As a result, they have the potential to protect taxpayers, improve many government services, and grow the economy.&rdquo;<br />
