<div title="One Agriculture" class="cushycms-wysiwyg"><strong>Broadening our Perspective</strong><br />
<br />
Andrew&rsquo;s grandfather started and served on the first Harrison County Conservation Board, and his Uncle Jim still farms corn and soy. He was part of the fifth generation of his family to walk beans, and the first to harvest aronia berries. His perspective on agriculture is one of a farmer who has dedicated time to both conventional and organic practices. Iowa, Andrew&rsquo;s home state, ranks first in corn and soy bean production in the country, but their third biggest cash-crop is projected to be the aronia berry, which his family reintroduced to the United Staes. The production level of Iowan, Midwestern, and American farmers is unparalleled. In order to protect the strong tradition our forebears created, Andrew believes we need to bridge the divide between the conventional and organic communities.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;For too long the debate has been too narrow. The current system pits conventional against organic and farmer against consumer. We need to work together, as one agricultural community, to create long-term solutions. Only then will our grandchildren have the opportunity to farm the same land as our grandfathers.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Andrew Pittz, 5th Generation Family Farmer<br />

<strong>A Nation of Farmers</strong><br />
<br />
Both large and small farms face unique challenges and opportunities in today&rsquo;s food economy. Andrew&rsquo;s perspective as a farmer and small businessman is that free-market, sustainable solutions like reinvesting our food dollars back into our communities and on-farm energy production will help small farmers without raising food costs. Meanwhile, large farms continue to positively impact our nation&rsquo;s import/export ledger. Protecting America&rsquo;s farmers is critical to maintaining our food security. We can support American farmers in a way that makes good economic sense, promotes health, and encourages land stewardship for generations to come.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;At a time when our import/export ledger is in the red, Iowa farmers grow more corn than Canada and nearly as much soy as China. Greater success for small farmers will only enhance America&rsquo;s agricultural dominance.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Andrew Pittz<br />

<strong>Reinvesting in Our Communities</strong><br />
<br />
Buying locally produced food reinvests our purchasing power back into our communities and has the potential to create thousands of new jobs. For example, in Washtenaw County, Michigan, residents found that spending 10% of their existing food budget on local foods injected $34 million in additional revenue back into the county&rsquo;s economy. These benefits make farming more profitable and give more families access to fresh, nutritious food. This will not only help folks live longer, healthier lives; it could also save Americans nearly $150 billion per year in obesity related medical costs. This also encourages crop diversity and greater entry into the market. Andrew&rsquo;s experience in the Des Moines &ldquo;Buy Fresh, Buy Local&rdquo; and the local farmers markets has illustrated first-hand the importance of supporting local family farms.<br />
<br />
<strong>On-Farm Energy</strong><br />
<br />
Wind energy holds tremendous potential, particularly in the small-farm heavy Midwest. Unfortunately, commercially owned wind turbines provide only marginal returns to family farms. Medium-sized, farmer owned turbines could dramatically cut farm energy costs, provide supplemental income for struggling family farms, and support families by lowering the cost of food. As the technology continues to improve, solar, hydro, and geothermal energy production will also be possible in some parts of the country. We have to do a better job of communicating the advantages of these energy sources, and creating a system where on-farm energy production is encouraged.<br />
<br />
<strong>Supporting Young Farmers</strong><br />
<br />
Farmers over the age of 55 control nearly half of America&rsquo;s farmland, while the number of entry-level farmers has declined 30% since 1987. Soon, the lack of young farmers could begin to jeopardize America&rsquo;s food security. As the youngest member of the USDA SARE- Farmer Rancher Committee, Andrew specializes in youth mentorship and agricultural marketing. As farming becomes more profitable, more young farmers will enter the profession. However, much more can be done to make entering farming easier, including innovative land-link programs and better access to start-up loans.</div>
