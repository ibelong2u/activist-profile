<div title="Community Engagement" class="cushycms-wysiwyg"><strong>Creating Value</strong><br />
<br />
Andrew&rsquo;s history in civic engagement began with his involvement in the Methodist Church. There, he partnered with Habitat for Humanity to help build low-income housing, and also ran community food drives. After leaving for college, Andrew&rsquo;s belief in serving his new community led him to create The Association for Social Entrepreneurship. The non-profit eventually created and coordinated with a coalition of over 30 local organizations. As Director of the organization, Andrew engaged community leaders and learned what makes an effective organization. The ASE utilized core business principles to create various community-wide programs, including community gardens for the food insecure and the Texas A&amp;M Sustainability Council, which was eventually absorbed into the Vice President&rsquo;s office as a university-supported program. Andrew is currently working with the USDA and various initiatives such as Iowa&rsquo;s Food and Farm Plan on issues related to growing our local economies by increasing agricultural output and providing mechanisms for new farmers to successfully join the profession.<br />

<strong>What is civic engagement?</strong><br />
<br />
Civic engagement, whether through Rotary and Lions Clubs, college organizations, or Church initiatives, is about building ongoing, permanent relationships for the purposes of applying a collective vision to better your community. Each organization&rsquo;s core values and goals are unique, but all are important in creating neighborhoods our schools and businesses can thrive in.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Civic engagement isn&rsquo;t about giving back - although that&rsquo;s certainly part of it. It&rsquo;s about creating an environment that fosters opportunity and growth. It&rsquo;s about creating value where there may not have been. It&rsquo;s about making folks&rsquo; lives just a little bit better.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<strong>How can your organization be more effective?</strong><br />
